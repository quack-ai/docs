Our goal is to make collaborative software development scale without losing any efficiency.
As teams get larger, it becomes challenging to maintain a consistent & efficient recipe for software development.
Code reviews are one of the main checkpoints and safeguards for team alignment today.
With code generation getting commoditized, we'll need to allocate more efforts on the alignment layer, which is where we step in.

## What we handle for you

Preparing your team for the next era of software engineering:
- Creating a requestable representative for your engineering culture
- Providing project-specific coding assistance 
- Powering next generation developer tools with this same alignment

## What is left up to you

You make the decisions, we handle the compliance:
- Decide the modifications you'd like to see in the way you produce software
- Allocate resources to produce code (written by humans, or generated by a model)
- Orchestrating the different parts of your software development workflow, and assign them the most relevant context

## How it works

The current version of the system relies on two main pipelines:
- Guideline curation & validation: parsing & confirming guidelines to build a useful context for AI-powered developer applications.
- Coding assistance: producing or completing software-related content with context awareness.

Both of these pipelines use deep learning models (namely language models, either instruction-tuned or completion-based).
