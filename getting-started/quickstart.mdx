## Curating team expectations

### Sign-up

Head over to [app.quackai.com](https://app.quackai.com/), click on "Login with GitHub" and follow the instructions.
Once signed up, you'll be brought back to the platform.

### Parsing guidelines

- Select one repo from the dropdown list (the public GitHub repositories on which you have maintainer access).
- Click on "Connect Repo"
- No guideline has been created yet, let's extract some from your repository by clicking on "Parse Repo"

### Editing & validating guidelines

- Discard the elements you don't want to include as your team's coding guidelines
- Click on any of the remaining guidelines
- Edit the instruction so that it's specific & clear enough to be one of the checkboxes you'd like to see completed before a pull request
- Click on "Generate Examples" to check how the system interprets it, adjust the text if necessary
- Click on "Save" to confirm it

## Try them out in your IDE

### Install the extension

Go to [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quackai.quack-companion), [Open VSX registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/quackai/quack-companion), or look for "Quack companion" in VSCode extension tab.
Install it, and follow the quick walkthrough to authenticate.

### Start coding

Open the folder corresponding to the repository for which you've edited guidelines. And start coding!
